* Data file

1. Organize data in a Google spreadsheet with the columns
| Column name  | Description                                                                                        |

| Type         | Single value; for sorting/filtering entries                                                        |
| Impact       | Single value; for sorting/filtering entries                                                        |

| Internal URL | Relative URL to Sandpoints entry                                                                   |
| Text         | Entry description                                                                                  |

2. Export to JSON with the plugin [[https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/export_sheet_data/903838927001][Export Sheet Data]].
3. Rename exported file to =data.js= and prefix its contents with =const json= (so that when the file is loaded, the data will be saved in the constant =json=. )
   #+begin_src js
const json= { Title of first entry...   }
   #+end_src


* Project directories
1. Add =data.js= in the directory =/data/=.
2. Add the required libraries in the =/lib/= directory:
   1. [[https://angularjs.org/][Angular JS]]
   2. Labella, Labella-extra
   3. D3
   4. D3Kit
   5. D3Kit-timeline
3. Add Bootrap to the =/css/= directory.
4. Run [[file:index.html][index.html]]
   1. This will load the JS libraries,
   2.
  
* Development timeline
A first version of this project made use of the Python version of the Labella library ([[https://github.com/GjjvdBurg/labella.py][Labella.py]] by Gertjan van den Burg), because of its capacity of outputting both PDF and SVG visualizations (via LaTeX). However, this implementation was extremely time intensive, requiring about 5 minutes to export a PDF. Eventually, I opted for the original Javascript version of this library that allowed for interaction and instant compilation of timeline visualizations.
