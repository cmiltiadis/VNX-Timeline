* Dev history
An earlier version of this project made use of a version of a Python version of the same library, [[https://github.com/GjjvdBurg/labella.py][Labella.py]] by Gertjan van den Burg, for outputting PDF and SVG visualizations.
However, generating such files was time-intensive (~ 5minutes).
Therefore, the JS version was eventually preferred due to the interactive and instant compilation of timelines.
